                        A lot of people ask why I use the moniker "DreadnoughtSix". Since high school, a lot of my buddies had really interesting online nicknames. My best friend is known as "tPenguinLTG" which stands for "The Penguin lost the Game". A buddy o' mine uses "MILLIONA1R" because his last name is "Nair". I had a hard time figuring mine out.
                        When I played video games online, my initial online name was "AssaultNinja23" with the intention of striking fear into my online enemies during gunfights. I mean, who wouldn't be afraid of a ninja who knows a good assault move here and there?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After a while, it died out. I didn't like how it sounded and it just didn't click anymore. I figured the best way to have a name was to make fun of myself. I then went by the online name "iM_XXL". During my freshman year in high school, I weighed a fairly large 250lbs at 5 feet 6 inches tall. I also wore size XXL. That's where that name came about.
                        During my sophomore year however, I played football for the school junior team. With the daily practices and becoming a starting lineup player, I lost a lot of weight. My shirt size eventually shrunk to XL, so my name didn't work anymore.

                        That, and I didn't like making fun of myself anymore.

                        Also that same year, my dad got me a guitar for Christmas. I've never played the guitar before but I was interested in learning. After a few months of learning a handful of chords and playing a few songs, I fell in love. The guitar that I've received then was a Yamaha Dreadnought Guitar. A guitar has six strings. <br>

                        Dreadnought guitar. Six strings. Thus, DreadnoughtSix.
