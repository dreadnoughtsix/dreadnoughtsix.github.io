                        <p>Nerds & Basketball is a weekly podcast hosted by CJ (DJ CJ) and Rahul (Post Sharmone) who are just 2 nerds who also love basketball (we like to keep it simple). <p>The idea of this podcast began with countless hours of conversation (we really should have been studying) between two roommates during the confusing time known as “1st year undergrad”. Jump to the even more confusing period known as senior year (*screams* Graduation) we finally decided to share these conversations through this podcast.</p> <p>Join us on this journey where we’ll discuss the latest NBA news while also throwing in some nerd culture to keep things interesting. As this whole idea started with our endless conversations, we want to keep the podcast in a similar format, just a quick conversationbetween two friends. We hope that you guys have as much fun listening to the podcast as we had making it! </p>

                            <p>Post Sharmone is an NBA insider specialist. He dives deep into how the (NBA) trade market looks, as well as studies the ins and outs of Adam Silver's mind. One of his favourite past times is drawing pictures of him and Paul George on a boat. He enjoys long walks on the beach and puppies.</p>

                            <p>DJ CJ is the resident bad boy of the team. As the head editor, he has so much power in what actually goes in the show or what doesn't that he sometimes gets power crazy. Basketball is his sport and he strives to be the next 5 feet 9 inch tall player to dunk (step aside Nate Robinson). He drinks water.</p>
