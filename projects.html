                    </h3>

                    <p>In my Software Design (CSC207) course, we designed and created a paint-like program. We created the canvas, created application utilities like shape creation, colour changing, and brushes.</p>

                    <p>This was an inefficent but working Java clone of PONG for my Grade 12 final project. It played with two players, having each player control a paddle. Player 1 would play with <strong>W</strong> and <strong>S</strong>, while Player 2 would play with the <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> arrow keys. Whoever plays and receives 7 points first wins the game.</p>

                    <p>Using nodeJS, I use the discord and discord-commando libraries to create a chatbot for my Discord server. Currently a work in progress, the chatbot imitates and acts like a corgi dog. You can pet it, feed it, and play games with it. More features to come in later iterations.<br> <em>Currently a private repository, please request a copy.</em></p>
